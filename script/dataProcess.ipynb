The Single Programming Document includes the following essential elements:\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an  appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional  policies in the United Kingdom;\nthe main priorities are:\n1. industrial and business development;\n2. development of knowledge-based industries;\n3. tourism development;\n4. community economic development;\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the Single Programming Document comprising:\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n- the financial implementation provisions,\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality and an initial evaluation of the latter;\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the  Single Programming Document;\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or  adaptation of the measures concerned. For the purpose of indexation, the annual breakdown of the global maximal allocation  foreseen for the assistance from the Structural Funds is as follows:\n>TABLE> The assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the Single  Programming Document amounts to a maximum of ECU 25,0 million.\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the  Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed  implementing provisions which form an integral part of the Single Programming Document.\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 26,50 million for the  public sector and ECU 13,75 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans,  in particular from the ECSC and EIB. 1.  The breakdown among the Structural Funds of the total Community assistance  available is as follows:\n- ERDF:ECU 18,82 million,\n- ESF:ECU  6,18 million.\n2.  The budgetary commitments at the moment of approval of the Single Programming Document refer to  the total Community assistance. The breakdown among the Structural Funds and the procedure for the grant of the  assistance may be altered subsequently, subject to the availability of funds and the budgetary  rules, in the light of adjustments decided according to the procedure laid down in Article 25 (5)  of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88. The Community aid concerns expenditure on operations under the Single Programming  Document which, in the Member State concerned, are the subject of legally binding commitments and  for which the requisite finance has been specifically allocated no later than 31 December 1996. The  final date for taking account of expenditure on these measures is 31 December 1998. The Single Programming Document shall be implemented in accordance with Community law,  and in particular Articles 6, 30, 48, 52 and 59 of the EC Treaty and the Community Directives on  the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts.

Through a number of State-controlled undertakings the Federal Republic of Germany engages in the production and distribution of coal. It owns:      - a controlling 40 % holding in Vereinigte Elektrizitäts- und Bergwerks-Aktiengesellschaft (VEBA), Bonn and Berlin ; the remainder of VEBA's shares is dispersed over a large number of holdings. VEBA holds 99.1 % of the share capital of Hugo Stinnes AG, Mülheim, an undertaking engaged in the wholesale coal trade, which itself holds controlling interests in this field. VEBA also has a 14.1 % share in the capital of the coalproducing undertaking Ruhrkohle AG;\n- about 83 % of the share capital of Vereinigte Industrie-Unternehmungen Aktiengesellschaft (VIAG), Berlin.\nTogether with VIAG, VEBA controls Braunschweigische Kohlenbergwerke (BKB), Helmstedt. BKB stopped production of brown coal briquettes on 1 April 1974, but it controls other smaller distribution undertakings within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty.\nBKB, together with VEBA, also controls BKB/Stinnes-Stromeyer GmbH, which is also a coal wholesaler.\nThe Federal Republic of Germany also owns:      - 76 % of the shares of Saarbergwerke AG, Saarbrücken, which is a coal-producing undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. Saarbergwerke has a majority holding in several coal distribution undertakings within the meaning of Article 80;\n- 100 % of the share capital of Salzgitter AG, which has a 10.8 % holding in Ruhrkohle AG.\n2. Gelsenberg AG is a group with activities in the fields of hydrocarbons, chemicals, nuclear processing/electricity generation, inland waterways, transport and distribution ; 48.3 % of its shares are held by Rheinisch-Westfälische Elektrizitätswerk-Aktiengesellschaft (RWE), Essen. The remainder of the shares is dispersed over a number of holdings. Its whollyowned subsidiary Raab Karcher GmbH is a coal distri-  bution undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. Raab Karcher GmbH has links with Bayerische Brennstoffhandel GmbH KG and Hansen Neuerburg Export-Import GmbH OHG : these last two undertakings are controlled jointly by Raab Karcher and other firms. Gelsenberg AG also has a 13.55 % holding in Ruhrkohle AG.\n3. The Federal Government proposes to acquire 51.3 % of the share capital of Gelsenberg AG. The combination of Gelsenberg AG and VEBA is designed to produce a viable large-scale group whose activities would centre on oil and electricity production. Since a merger of the two undertakings means the combination of their coal production and distribution businesses too, this constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 66 (1).\nThe Federal Government controls, directly or indirectly, other undertakings within the meaning of Article 80. With regard however to these holdings of the Federal Government it should be noted that the undertakings controlled by the Government are not subject to any central planning or decision-making authority but are operated as economically independent undertakings. Although therefore VEBA, Vereinigte Industrie-Unternehmungen AG, Saarbergwerke AG and Salzgitter AG are effectively linked to each other, nevertheless the connection does not bring about any restrictive effect on competition. Consequently, assessment of the concentration can be confined to the integration of Gelsenberg AG into VEBA.\n4. VEBA and Gelsenberg AG, like all shareholders of Ruhrkohle AG, were formerly mining companies and transferred their mining holdings to Ruhrkohle AG in 1969. Like the many other shareholders, they do not have a large enough shareholding to control Ruhrkohle AG. Acquisition of holdings in Gelsenberg AG will, however, give the Federal Government a further 13.55 % of the shares of Ruhrkohle AG. The undertakings controlled by the Federal Government will then hold approximately 39 % of the capital of Ruhrkohle and will undoubtedly have a considerable influence on its business policy. However, there are no indications that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany could use its strengthened position to modify the supply conditions of Ruhrkohle AG so as to favour the merchants controlled by it. In addition the terms of business of Ruhrkohle AG as authorized by the Commission (1) ensure equal treatment for all wholesalers in terms of direct purchasing from Ruhrkohle AG.\nThe change in the pattern of ownership of Ruhrkohle AG will thus not give the VEBA/Gelsenberg AG Group any advantage as regards access to production.\n5. To judge by 1973 figures, annual sales of solid fuels on the relevant market (the Federal Republic of Germany) can be expected to be as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0004905\">\nThe total sales of approximately ... metric tons per annum by the two undertakings to be merged represent some 33 % of total sales by coal wholesalers on the relevant market. This share of the wholesale market will be the largest in the Federal Republic. However there are seven other coal wholesalers in the Federal Republic with market shares of between 5 and 10 %. And there are about 150 smaller undertakings. Consequently, and because these wholesalers are widely scattered throughout the Federal Republic of Germany consumers still have a wide choice in covering their requirements for solid fuels despite the concentration amounting to 33 % of the market.\nVEBA/Gelsenberg AG are not in a position to fix prices for solid fuels. Of the approximately... metric tons of solid fuels sold in 1973, about... metric tons were produced in the Community. Since the trade margin allowed for this coal by the main supplier fields is only about 4 % of the list price, the two undertakings cannot sell at much below list price. On the other hand, VEBA/Gelsenberg AG can only raise prices as far as the competition from fuel oil allows, because for many years the price of fuel oil has been well below that of Community coal. This applies also, though to a lesser extent, to the approximately ... metric tons of coal imported in 1973. VEBA/Gelsenberg AG account for approximately ... % of the market in coal imports from non-Community countries - a market position of much the same strength as their position in the wholesale coal business as a whole. However, prices for imported coal from the duty-free import quota have invariably been above the price for fuel oil. The only exception is coal from state-trading countries, some of which has been imported at the same price as fuel oil.\nThis price situation has changed substantially the wholesale fuel trade in two ways : most consumers have converted their installations to use fuel-oil or modified them to use either solid or liquid fuels. As a result the coal wholesalers in Germany sold about 49 000 000 metric tons of fuel oil in 1973 in addition to solid fuels. This means that currently only about 30  (1)OJ No L 120, 7.5.1973, p. 14.\nto 32 % of sales by coal wholesalers (ton for ton) is accounted for by solid fuels : by far the greater part of their business is in fuel oil. The oil companies, however, also sold about 33 000 000 metric tons direct rather than through coal wholesalers. As a result there is less opportunity today for a wholesaler to exploit a strong market position. The possibility of substituting fuel oil for solid fuel and the appearance of new competitors in the market ensure a sufficently competitive situation. This competition among wholesalers is primarily in terms of the variety of their supplies, their reputation for delivery on time, quality, delivery arrangements and their treatment of complaints.\nIn determining whether the merger of the two undertakings might afford them other exceptional competitive advantage, consideration should be given to the fact that they have their own inland waterway vessels. VEBA and Gelsenberg AG have a carrying capacity of their own which enabled them in 1971 to transport about ... % and ... % respectively of total shipments by German firms within the Federal Republic of Germany and to and from foreign ports. However, less than 20 % of the solid fuels sold in the Federal Republic of Germany is shipped by water, and VEBA and Gelsenberg AG each carried less than ... % of their solid fuels sales in their own vessels. Another pointer indicating that the two undertakings will not gain a privileged position through the use of their own vessels is the fact that on inland waterways the supply of cargo space exceeds demand and VEBA/Gelsenberg AG have no direct influence on transport charges since waterway freight charges, where not fixed at set rates (as in German domestic traffic), are determined freely on the freight market. Given this market structure and this relationship between supply and demand, the two undertakings have virtually no scope for granting special terms to buyers to make use of their transport facilities.\n6. Consequently, the merger will not enable the undertakings involved to determine prices or to control or restrict distribution in a substantial part of the solid fuel market or to evade the rules of competition instituted under the Treaty. Also, it will not give them an artificially privileged position affording a substantial advantage in access to supplies or markets,",

Through a number of State-controlled undertakings the Federal Republic of Germany engages in the production and distribution of coal. It owns:      - a controlling 40 % holding in Vereinigte Elektrizitäts- und Bergwerks-Aktiengesellschaft (VEBA), Bonn and Berlin ; the remainder of VEBA's shares is dispersed over a large number of holdings. VEBA holds 99.1 % of the share capital of Hugo Stinnes AG, Mülheim, an undertaking engaged in the wholesale coal trade, which itself holds controlling interests in this field. VEBA also has a 14.1 % share in the capital of the coalproducing undertaking Ruhrkohle AG;\n- about 83 % of the share capital of Vereinigte Industrie-Unternehmungen Aktiengesellschaft (VIAG), Berlin.\nTogether with VIAG, VEBA controls Braunschweigische Kohlenbergwerke (BKB), Helmstedt. BKB stopped production of brown coal briquettes on 1 April 1974, but it controls other smaller distribution undertakings within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty.\nBKB, together with VEBA, also controls BKB/Stinnes-Stromeyer GmbH, which is also a coal wholesaler.\nThe Federal Republic of Germany also owns:      - 76 % of the shares of Saarbergwerke AG, Saarbrücken, which is a coal-producing undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. Saarbergwerke has a majority holding in several coal distribution undertakings within the meaning of Article 80;\n- 100 % of the share capital of Salzgitter AG, which has a 10.8 % holding in Ruhrkohle AG.\n2. Gelsenberg AG is a group with activities in the fields of hydrocarbons, chemicals, nuclear processing/electricity generation, inland waterways, transport and distribution ; 48.3 % of its shares are held by Rheinisch-Westfälische Elektrizitätswerk-Aktiengesellschaft (RWE), Essen. The remainder of the shares is dispersed over a number of holdings. Its whollyowned subsidiary Raab Karcher GmbH is a coal distri-  bution undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty. Raab Karcher GmbH has links with Bayerische Brennstoffhandel GmbH KG and Hansen Neuerburg Export-Import GmbH OHG : these last two undertakings are controlled jointly by Raab Karcher and other firms. Gelsenberg AG also has a 13.55 % holding in Ruhrkohle AG.\n3. The Federal Government proposes to acquire 51.3 % of the share capital of Gelsenberg AG. The combination of Gelsenberg AG and VEBA is designed to produce a viable large-scale group whose activities would centre on oil and electricity production.

Further, the Eurosystem's minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds are specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework rules for marketable assets, as laid down in Section 6.3.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.\n(3) The suspension of the Eurosystem's minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds applicable to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic, initially decided by the Governing Council on 6 May 2010, was an exceptional and temporary measure which was based on the positive assessment by the Governing Council of compliance with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme. At the time, the Governing Council took into consideration the fact that the Hellenic Republic had approved a programme which the Governing Council considered to be appropriate so that, from a credit risk management perspective, the marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic retained a quality standard sufficient for their continued eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations, irrespective of any external credit assessment. Moreover, the Governing Council took into consideration the strong commitment of the Greek Government to fully implement that programme (3).\n(4) Under Article 8 of Guideline ECB/2014/31, the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds do not apply to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the central governments of euro area Member States under a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme, unless the Governing Council decides that the respective Member State no longer complies with the conditionality of its financial support and/or macroeconomic programme.

Consequently, the Hellenic Republic is no longer deemed to be in compliance with the conditionality of the programme and, as a result, the conditions for the temporary suspension of the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds in respect of such instruments, as set out in Article 8(2) of Guideline ECB/2014/31, are no longer fulfilled.

At the time, the Governing Council took into consideration the fact that the Hellenic Republic had approved a programme which the Governing Council considered to be appropriate so that, from a credit risk management perspective, the marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic retained a quality standard sufficient for their continued eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations, irrespective of any external credit assessment. Moreover, the Governing Council took into consideration the strong commitment of the Greek Government to fully implement that programme (3).\n(4) Under Article 8 of Guideline ECB/2014/31, the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds do not apply to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the central governments of euro area Member States under a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme, unless the Governing Council decides that the respective Member State no longer complies with the conditionality of its financial support and/or macroeconomic programme. Under Article 1(3) of the same Guideline, the Hellenic Republic is, for the purposes of Article 6(1) and Article 8 of that Guideline, considered a euro area Member State compliant with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme.\n(5) On the basis of the information available, the Governing Council has made an assessment, according to which it is not currently possible to assume a successful conclusion of the review of the European Union/International Monetary Fund programme for the Hellenic Republic. Consequently, the Hellenic Republic is no longer deemed to be in compliance with the conditionality of the programme and, as a result, the conditions for the temporary suspension of the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds in respect of such instruments, as set out in Article 8(2) of Guideline ECB/2014/31, are no longer fulfilled. As a consequence, the Governing Council has decided that the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds shall apply in respect of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic,\nEligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic\n1.   For the purposes of Article 6(1) and Article 8 of Guideline ECB/2014/31, the Hellenic Republic shall no longer be considered to be in compliance with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme.\n2.   The Eurosystem's minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds, as set out in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework rules for certain marketable assets in Section 6.3.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, shall apply in the case of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic.\n3.   In the event of any discrepancy between this Decision, Guideline ECB/2011/14 and Guideline ECB/2014/31, as implemented at national level by the NCBs, this Decision shall prevail. Entry into force\nThis Decision shall enter into force on 11 February 2015.",

         "5.12.2007 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 317/79\nCOMMISSION DECISION\nof 4 December 2007\nsuspending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1420/2007 on imports of silico-manganese originating in the People’s Republic of China and Kazakhstan\n(2007/789/EC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES",
         ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 14(4) thereof,\nAfter consulting the Advisory Committee,\nWhereas:\nA.   PROCEDURE\n(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1420/2007 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of silico-manganese (including ferro-silico-manganese) (SiMn) originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Kazakhstan, falling within CN codes 7202 30 00 and ex 8111 00 11 (TARIC code 8111001110) (the product concerned). The rate of the anti-dumping duty is 8,2 % and 6,5 % for the product originating in the PRC and Kazakhstan respectively.\n(2) Information on a change of market conditions, which occurred after the original investigation period, indicated in Regulation (EC) No 1420/2007, and which might justify the suspension of the measures imposed, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, was obtained by the Commission. Consequently, the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted.\nB.   GROUNDS\n(3) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that, in the Community interest, anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension, provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.\n(4) Since the original investigation period, an increase in world prices for SiMn was observed, indicating a change of the market situation and conditions. In view of this, the Commission has carried out a further investigation to assess the recent evolution of volumes and prices of the product concerned for the period between 1 July 2006 and 30 September 2007 and their impact on the injury suffered by the Community industry as well as the overall Community interest.\n(5) On the basis of the information gathered, it was established that market prices of SiMn on the Community market have increased after the original investigation period until the third quarter of year 2007 by around 69 %, i.e. from an average EUR 622/MT in the third quarter of year 2006 to an average EUR 1 051/MT in the third quarter of year 2007. In particular, a significant increase of around 42 % was to be observed between the second and the third quarter of year 2007. These trends can also be found in other major markets across the world as well as for imports of SiMn into the Community.\n(6) SiMn is a key raw material used for the production of steel. The price increase described above can be attributed to the temporary supply shortages combined with a higher demand for SiMn due to increased demand for steel worldwide. Evidence from previous sudden price increases such as the one that occurred in year 2004 shows that such demand-supply imbalances in this market are of temporary nature. Prices tend to return to their long-term levels once the spare capacities for SiMn are fully utilised.\n(7) Between the original investigation period and the period from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007 the market share of imports of SiMn originating in the PRC and Kazakhstan decreased by 0,6 percentage points to 9,8 % of the overall Community consumption. EC consumption has increased by 20 %.\n(8) With regard to the Community industry, it is to be noted that since the original investigation period, the situation of the Community industry has improved. Between the original investigation period and the period from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007, the sales and production volumes have increased by 15 % and 19 % respectively. However, the market share of the Community industry decreased by 1,1 percentage points to 23,8 %. The profit situation improved significantly and the profitability of the Community industry reached 42 % in the third quarter of year 2007, thus substantially surpassing even the 5 % profit level established as appropriate by the original investigation.\n(9) As indicated in recitals 157 to 163 of Regulation (EC) No 1420/2007, the imposition of measures in question was expected to have some negative, although limited, effects for users in the form of cost increases arising out of the possible need to arrange new or alternative supplies. Considering the temporary change in market conditions and that consequently the Community industry is currently not suffering injury, any negative effect on users could be removed by suspending the measures. Consequently, it can be concluded that the suspension is in the overall Community interest.\n(10) Given the temporary change in market conditions, and in particular the high level of prices of SiMn existing on the Community market, which is far higher than the injurious price level found in the original investigation, together with the alleged demand-supply imbalance of the product concerned, it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC and Kazakhstan is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension. It is therefore proposed to suspend for nine months the measures in force in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation.\nC.   CONSULTATION OF COMMUNITY INDUSTRY\n(11) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in question. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and did not oppose the suspension of the anti-dumping measures.\nD.   CONCLUSION\n(12) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently, the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1420/2007 should be suspended for a period of nine months.\n(13) The Commission will monitor the development of imports and the prices of the product concerned. Should a situation arise at any time in which increased volumes at dumped prices of the product concerned from the PRC and Kazakhstan resume and consequently cause injury to the Community industry, the Commission will take the necessary steps to reinstate the anti-dumping duty, taking into account the substantive rules that govern an injury assessment. An interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation might be initiated, if appropriate,",

         "25.3.2014 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 89/3\nCOUNCIL DECISION 2014/162/EU\nof 11 March 2014\namending Decision 2004/162/EC with regard to its implementation in Mayotte from 1 January 2014\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION",
         ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),\nActing in accordance with a special legislative procedure,\nWhereas:\n(1) Council Decision 2004/162/EC (2) authorises the French authorities to apply exemptions or reductions to dock dues in respect of products produced locally in the French outermost regions and listed in the Annex to that Decision. Those exemptions or reductions constitute specific measures designed to offset the specific constraints faced by the outermost regions which increase production costs for local companies and make it difficult for their products to compete with the same products imported from metropolitan France and other Member States. Mayotte’s situation is the same as that of the other French outermost regions.\n(2) In accordance with European Council Decision 2012/419/EU (3), with effect from 1 January 2014 Mayotte became an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Union law should therefore be applicable to Mayotte from that date.\n(3) The French authorities have requested that Decision 2004/162/EC be applicable to Mayotte with effect from 1 January 2014, and have submitted a list of the products to which they wish to apply differentiated taxation, on the basis of whether the products are produced locally or not.\n(4) This Decision should authorise the French authorities to apply differentiated taxation to the products for which they have proven: firstly, that local production exists; secondly, that a significant importation of goods (including from metropolitan France and other Member States) could jeopardise the continuation of local production; and thirdly, that additional costs exist which increase the cost price of local production in comparison to products produced elsewhere, compromising the competitiveness of products produced locally.

Those exemptions or reductions constitute specific measures designed to offset the specific constraints faced by the outermost regions which increase production costs for local companies and make it difficult for their products to compete with the same products imported from metropolitan France and other Member States. Mayotte’s situation is the same as that of the other French outermost regions.\n(2) In accordance with European Council Decision 2012/419/EU (3), with effect from 1 January 2014 Mayotte became an outermost region within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Union law should therefore be applicable to Mayotte from that date.\n(3) The French authorities have requested that Decision 2004/162/EC be applicable to Mayotte with effect from 1 January 2014, and have submitted a list of the products to which they wish to apply differentiated taxation, on the basis of whether the products are produced locally or not.\n(4) This Decision should authorise the French authorities to apply differentiated taxation to the products for which they have proven: firstly, that local production exists; secondly, that a significant importation of goods (including from metropolitan France and other Member States) could jeopardise the continuation of local production; and thirdly, that additional costs exist which increase the cost price of local production in comparison to products produced elsewhere, compromising the competitiveness of products produced locally. The authorised tax differential should not exceed the proven additional costs. Applying those principles and taking into account the specific structural social and economic situation of Mayotte as a new outermost region, which is compounded by exactly the same special constraints which justified the derogation in Decision 2004/162/EC for the other French outermost regions in accordance with Article 349 TFEU, the proposed specific measures for Mayotte are justified, without going beyond what is necessary and without creating an unjustified advantage for local production in this new outermost region.\n(5) The products in respect of which the French authorities have provided those three types of proof are listed in Parts A, B and C of the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC.

         "COMMISSION  DECISION\nof 26 September 1984\naccepting undertakings given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and terminating that proceeding\n(84/465/EEC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN\nCOMMUNITIES",
         ",\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,\nHaving regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,\nAfter consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,\nWhereas:\nA. Procedure\n(1) In January 1984 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the 'Union professionnelle des usines belges d'asbeste ciment' on behalf of producers representing the majority of Community production of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets falling within subheading ex 68.12 A of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 68.12-11, originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and commenced an investigation.\n(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.\n(3) The known exporter and importers of the product concerned originating in Czechoslovakia requested and were granted a hearing.\n(4) The exporter and importers of the product concerned originating in Czechoslovakia requested and were granted the opportunity to meet the complainants for the purpose of presenting their opposing views.\n(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:\n(i) EEC producers\n(a) Belgium\n- Eternit NV, Kapelle-op-den-Bos,\n- S. A. Fabrecim, Harmignies,\n- J. M. Balmatt NV, Mol,\n- NV Scheerders van Kerhove's Ver. Fabrieken, St. Niklaas;\n(b) The Netherlands\n- Eternit BV, Amsterdam;\n(c) France\n- Eternit Industries SA, Vernouillet,\n- Everitube SA, Paris;\n(d) Federal Republic of Germany\nEternit AG, Berlin;\n(ii) Producer in Finland\n(for the purpose of determining the normal value):\nOy Partek AB, Muijala;\n(iii) Importers\n(a) Belgium\nEts. D. Van Riet, Temse, for the product originating in the German Democratic Republic;\n(b) The Netherlands\n- A. de Boo Delft BV, Delft (assisted by a representative of P. N. M. Hooge-ChemicaliĂŤn BV, Vught, acting as the agent of the exporter of the German Democratic Republic),\n- Austria BV, Lisse, for the product originating in Czechoslovakia.\n(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 January to 31 December 1983.\nB. Normal value\n(7) In order to establish whether the imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic were dumped, the Commission had to take account of the fact that these countries do not have market economies. The Commission therefore based its determination of the normal value in a market-economy country.\n(8) In this connection, the complainants had suggested the Finnish market. However, most of the exporters and importers contested the use of Finnish domestic prices, mainly because these parties considered that these prices do not result from a normal supply and demand situation. Therefore, it was suggested by these parties to use Spanish prices for sales on the domestic market or for export to the EEC.\n(9) Although the arguments presented by the exporters and importers were not considered by the Commission to constitute by themselves sufficient reasons for rejecting Finland as the market-economy third country for the determination of the normal value, the Commission, nevertheless, examined the possibility of establishing normal value on the basis of the prices of the Spanish product. However, the Commission was informed that its representatives could not be received at the premises of the individual producers in Spain, but that an investigation could take place at the office of the Spanish association of asbestos-cement producers. This proposal was not considered acceptable by the Commission, since there were not sufficient guarantees offered that would enable the Commission's representatives to carry out a thorough investigation covering all information necessary to determine the normal value in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, particularly concerning the profitability relating to the sales made by each of the Spanish producers of the product concerned.\n(10) Taking into account the fact that no other alternatives had been put forward by the interested parties, except for Austria, with regard to which no evidence or arguments had been submitted, and in order to avoid further delays at this stage of the proceeding, it was provisionally decided that the constructed value calculated for the manufacturer of the product concerned in Finland is to be considered as the most appropriate and reasonable basis for the determination of the normal value, since by taking the constructed value as the basis for this calculation, the main objection raised by the exporters and importers (see point 8) does not apply. The constructed value was computed by taking the company's total cost of materials and manufacture, including overheads and a modest profit margin, considered reasonable in this case.\nC. Export price\n(11) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid for the product sold for export to the Community.\nD. Comparison\n(12) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. This was the case for differences in conditions and terms of sale in so far as a direct relationship could be satisfactorily demonstrated. These differences concerned in particular credit terms, transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs. All comparisons were made at ex-works level.\nE. Margins\n(13) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of all the exporters concerned, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the prices for export to the Community.\n(14) These margins vary according to the exporter concerned and the importing Member State, the weighted average dumping margin with regard to each of the exporting countries being as follows:\n- Czechoslovakia: 82 %\n- the German Democratic Republic: 77 %\nF. Injury\n(15) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets increased from 26 780 tonnes in 1980 to 30 947 tonnes in 1983, which represents an increase of 15,5 %. In the Benelux countries these imports increased from 9 188 tonnes in 1980 to 21 161 tonnes in 1983, which represents an increase of 130 %.\n(16) With regard to the combined market share held by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that it increased from 1,4 % in 1980 to 2,3 % in 1983 in the Community, which represents an increase of 64 %. Furthermore, in the Benelux countries, where these imports were concentrated, this market share increased from 5,8 to 20,4 % between 1980 and 1983, which represents an increase of 250 %.\n(17) The resale prices of these imports undercut the prices of the Community producers concerned in this proceeding during the investigation period by 15 %.\n(18) These imports have been a main cause of the increasing difficulties encountered in a declining market by the Community producers concerned in this proceeding. As such, these dumped imports contributed to the reduction of their production, which dropped by 21,4 % between 1980 and 1983, to the reduction of their capacity utilization, which dropped from 72 % in 1980 to 64 % in 1983 despite the lowering of their capacity by 12 % during the same period, and to the reduction of their sales, which dropped by 15,5 % between 1980 and 1983.\n(19) With regard to the development of the profitability of the Community producers concerned in this proceeding, it has been established that between 1980 and 1983 profits either dropped significantly or considerable losses were made.\n(20) Between 1980 and 1983 the number of employees of these Community producers was significantly reduced.\n(21) It has been argued by some exporters and importers that injury has been caused not by the dumped imports, but by sales of the product concerned originating in Italy. Although it appears on the basis of the evidence available to the Commission that sales of the product concerned originating in Italy increased significantly between 1980 and 1983, the prices at which this product was sold were, on average, 15 % above the prices of the dumped products. The substantial increase of the dumped products, particularly in the Benelux countries, and the prices at which they are offered for sale in these Member States, led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets originating both in Czechoslovakia and in the German Democratic Republic taken in isolation, have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community producers concerned in this proceeding.\nG. Community interest\n(22) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community producers concerned in this proceeding and particularly the negative development of their profitability, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken.\nH. Undertakings\n(23) The exporters concerned were informed of the main findings of the preliminary investigation and commented on them. Undertakings were subsequently offered by the exporters established in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic concerning their exports of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets to the Community. (24) The effect of the said undertakings will be to increase their export prices to the Community to the level which the Commission, having taken into account, on the one hand, the selling price necessary to provide an adequate return to Community producers and, on the other hand, the purchase price of the Community importers and their costs and profit margin, considered necessary to eliminate injury. These increases in no case exceed the dumping margins found in the investigation.\n(25) In these circumstances, the undertakings offered are considered acceptable and the proceeding may, therefore, be terminated without imposition of anti-dumping duties.\n(26) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,",

Procedure\n(1) In January 1984 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the 'Union professionnelle des usines belges d'asbeste ciment' on behalf of producers representing the majority of Community production of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets falling within subheading ex 68.12 A of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 68.12-11, originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and commenced an investigation.\n(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.\n(3) The known exporter and importers of the product concerned originating in Czechoslovakia requested and were granted a hearing.\n(4) The exporter and importers of the product concerned originating in Czechoslovakia requested and were granted the opportunity to meet the complainants for the purpose of presenting their opposing views.\n(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:\n(i) EEC producers\n(a) Belgium\n- Eternit NV, Kapelle-op-den-Bos,\n- S. A. Fabrecim, Harmignies,\n- J. M. Balmatt NV, Mol,\n- NV Scheerders van Kerhove's Ver. Fabrieken, St. Niklaas;\n(b) The Netherlands\n- Eternit BV, Amsterdam;\n(c) France\n- Eternit Industries SA, Vernouillet,\n- Everitube SA, Paris;\n(d) Federal Republic of Germany\nEternit AG, Berlin;\n(ii) Producer in Finland\n(for the purpose of determining the normal value):\nOy Partek AB, Muijala;\n(iii) Importers\n(a) Belgium\nEts. D. Van Riet, Temse, for the product originating in the German Democratic Republic;\n(b) The Netherlands\n- A. de Boo Delft BV, Delft (assisted by a representative of P. N. M. Hooge-ChemicaliĂŤn BV, Vught, acting as the agent of the exporter of the German Democratic Republic),\n- Austria BV, Lisse, for the product originating in Czechoslovakia.\n(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 January to 31 December 1983.\nB. Normal value\n(7) In order to establish whether the imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic were dumped, the Commission had to take account of the fact that these countries do not have market economies. The Commission therefore based its determination of the normal value in a market-economy country.\n(8) In this connection, the complainants had suggested the Finnish market. However, most of the exporters and importers contested the use of Finnish domestic prices, mainly because these parties considered that these prices do not result from a normal supply and demand situation. Therefore, it was suggested by these parties to use Spanish prices for sales on the domestic market or for export to the EEC.\n(9) Although the arguments presented by the exporters and importers were not considered by the Commission to constitute by themselves sufficient reasons for rejecting Finland as the market-economy third country for the determination of the normal value, the Commission, nevertheless, examined the possibility of establishing normal value on the basis of the prices of the Spanish product. However, the Commission was informed that its representatives could not be received at the premises of the individual producers in Spain, but that an investigation could take place at the office of the Spanish association of asbestos-cement producers. This proposal was not considered acceptable by the Commission, since there were not sufficient guarantees offered that would enable the Commission's representatives to carry out a thorough investigation covering all information necessary to determine the normal value in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, particularly concerning the profitability relating to the sales made by each of the Spanish producers of the product concerned.\n(10) Taking into account the fact that no other alternatives had been put forward by the interested parties, except for Austria, with regard to which no evidence or arguments had been submitted, and in order to avoid further delays at this stage of the proceeding, it was provisionally decided that the constructed value calculated for the manufacturer of the product concerned in Finland is to be considered as the most appropriate and reasonable basis for the determination of the normal value, since by taking the constructed value as the basis for this calculation, the main objection raised by the exporters and importers (see point 8) does not apply. The constructed value was computed by taking the company's total cost of materials and manufacture, including overheads and a modest profit margin, considered reasonable in this case.\nC. Export price\n(11) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid for the product sold for export to the Community.\nD. Comparison\n(12) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. This was the case for differences in conditions and terms of sale in so far as a direct relationship could be satisfactorily demonstrated. These differences concerned in particular credit terms, transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs. All comparisons were made at ex-works level.\nE. Margins\n(13) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of all the exporters concerned, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the prices for export to the Community.\n(14) These margins vary according to the exporter concerned and the importing Member State, the weighted average dumping margin with regard to each of the exporting countries being as follows:\n- Czechoslovakia: 82 %\n- the German Democratic Republic: 77 %\nF. Injury\n(15) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets increased from 26 780 tonnes in 1980 to 30 947 tonnes in 1983, which represents an increase of 15,5 %. In the Benelux countries these imports increased from 9 188 tonnes in 1980 to 21 161 tonnes in 1983, which represents an increase of 130 %.\n(16) With regard to the combined market share held by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that it increased from 1,4 % in 1980 to 2,3 % in 1983 in the Community, which represents an increase of 64 %. Furthermore, in the Benelux countries, where these imports were concentrated, this market share increased from 5,8 to 20,4 % between 1980 and 1983, which represents an increase of 250 %.\n(17) The resale prices of these imports undercut the prices of the Community producers concerned in this proceeding during the investigation period by 15 %.\n(18) These imports have been a main cause of the increasing difficulties encountered in a declining market by the Community producers concerned in this proceeding. As such, these dumped imports contributed to the reduction of their production, which dropped by 21,4 % between 1980 and 1983, to the reduction of their capacity utilization, which dropped from 72 % in 1980 to 64 % in 1983 despite the lowering of their capacity by 12 % during the same period, and to the reduction of their sales, which dropped by 15,5 % between 1980 and 1983.\n(19) With regard to the development of the profitability of the Community producers concerned in this proceeding, it has been established that between 1980 and 1983 profits either dropped significantly or considerable losses were made.\n(20) Between 1980 and 1983 the number of employees of these Community producers was significantly reduced.\n(21) It has been argued by some exporters and importers that injury has been caused not by the dumped imports, but by sales of the product concerned originating in Italy. Although it appears on the basis of the evidence available to the Commission that sales of the product concerned originating in Italy increased significantly between 1980 and 1983, the prices at which this product was sold were, on average, 15 % above the prices of the dumped products. The substantial increase of the dumped products, particularly in the Benelux countries, and the prices at which they are offered for sale in these Member States, led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets originating both in Czechoslovakia and in the German Democratic Republic taken in isolation, have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community producers concerned in this proceeding.\nG.

These increases in no case exceed the dumping margins found in the investigation.\n(25) In these circumstances, the undertakings offered are considered acceptable and the proceeding may, therefore, be terminated without imposition of anti-dumping duties.\n(26) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,\nThe undertakings given by the following companies:\n- Czechoslovak Ceramics Foreign Trade Corporation, Prague (Czechoslovakia),\n- Limex GmbH, Bau-Export-Import, Berlin (German Democratic Republic),\nin connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of asbestos-cement corrugated sheets falling within subheading ex 68.12 A of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 68.12-11, originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, are hereby accepted.

In the case of a Member State making use of this facility, the provisions of Article 9 (3) (b) of the Directive shall also apply to these services.\nTelecommunications services shall be deemed to be services relating to the transmission, emission or reception of signals, writing, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems, including the transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for such transmission, emission or reception.

         "2000/817/EC: Commission Decision of 27 December 2000 concerning the non-inclusion of permethrin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance (notified under document number C(2000) 4140) (Text with EEA relevance)\n\n,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/68/EC(2), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,\nHaving regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4) and in particular Article 7(3a)b) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant-protection products which were already on the market on 15 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.\n(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5) of 27 April 1994, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6) has designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time in accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.\n(3) Permethrin is one of the 90 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.\n(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Ireland, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 10 June 1998 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(1) of this Regulation.\n(5) The assessment report prepared by Ireland was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 13 July 2000 in the format of the Commission review report for permethin, in accordance with Article 7(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.\n(6) It has appeared from the assessments made that the submitted information is not sufficient to demonstrate that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant-protection products containing the active substance concerned satisfy the requirements laid down in Articles 5(1)(a) and (b) and 5(2)(b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(7) All notifiers informed the Commission and the rapporteur Member State that they no longer wished to participate in the programme of work for this active substance. Therefore, the further information which would be required to demonstrate that permethrin fully complies with the requirements of Directive 91/414/EEC will not be submitted.\n(8) Therefore, it is not possible to include this active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(9) Technical evidence has been provided indicating that limited further use of permethrin in forestry could be allowed whilst research is ongoing in order to find efficient alternatives providing that appropriate risk mitigation measures are taken.\n(10) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant-protection products containing permethrin allowed by Member States, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC should be limited to a period no longer than 18 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.\n(11) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC(7).\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,\nPermethrin is not included as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. The Member States shall ensure:\n1. that authorisations for all uses of plant-protection products containing permethrin are withdrawn within a period of six months from the date of adoption of the present Decision except for the uses referred to in paragraph 2;\n2. that the authorisations for uses of plant-protection products containing permethrin in young plants for forestry are withdrawn not later than on 25 July 2003;\n3. that from the date of the present Decision no authorisations for plant-protection products containing permethrin will be granted or renewed under the derogation provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, except for the uses referred to in paragraph 2. Any period of grace granted by a Member State in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and not longer than 18 months from the date of adoption of the present Decision. For the uses referred to in Article 2(2) the period of grace shall expire not later than on 31 December 2003. This Decision is addressed to the Member States.",
