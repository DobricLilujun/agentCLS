They provided the Commission with all the relevant information to that effect. The other Member States were informed of the request on 15 October 2004.\\n(2) The derogating measure is intended to exclude certain magazines and periodicals imported into Denmark from the exemption under Article 14(1)(d) of the Directive and to apply VAT on them. That Article was implemented by Directive 83/181/EEC\\xa0(2), which stipulates that goods of a total value not exceeding EU-10 shall be exempt from VAT on admission. Member States may grant exemption for imported goods of a total value of more than EU-10, but not exceeding EUR\\xa022. Denmark currently exempts from VAT imports from third countries of all small consignments with a commercial nature. The Danish limit for VAT exemption is DKK\\xa080 (EU-10).\\n(3) The Danish authorities have discovered that some publishing companies re-route the distribution of their publications to subscribers in Denmark via territories not covered by the Sixth Directive, with a loss in revenue for Denmark and consequently with a negative impact on the Community’s own resources. There is the risk that the loss of revenue will increase unless Denmark is authorised to prevent this type of tax avoidance.\\n(4) The request for derogation only targets the consignments and situations connected with the avoidance scheme and does not intend to exclude all mail order consignments from the exemption on the basis of Article 22 of Directive 83/181/EEC. It therefore appears that the proposed derogation from Article 14(1)(d) of Directive 77/388/EEC is in fact the most appropriate solution in this specific case.\\n(5) The derogation avoids the loss of VAT and will therefore not adversely affect the Communities’ own resources,\\nBy way of derogation from Article 14(1)(d) of Directive 77/388/EEC, Denmark is authorised to apply VAT on the importation into Denmark of magazines, periodicals or the like, printed in the territory of the Community, as defined in Article 3 of the said Directive and sent to private individuals in Denmark. This Decision shall apply until 31 December 2010. This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.\\n\\n<<<END OF INPUT>>>\\n'}]",

This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the said objective.\\n(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).\\n(9) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,\\nThis Directive shall apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex.\\nHowever, this Directive shall not apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex when they take the following forms: icing sugars, candy sugars, sugars in loaf form. Directive 2000/13/EC shall apply to the products defined in Part A of the Annex hereto subject to the following conditions and derogations:\\n1. Without prejudice to point 5 below, the product names listed in Part A of the Annex shall apply only to the products referred to therein and shall be used in trade to designate them.\\nThe product name referred to in point 2 of Part A of the Annex may also be used to designate the product referred to in point 3 thereof.\\nHowever,\\n- the products defined in Part A of the Annex may, in addition to the compulsory product name, also bear qualifying terms commonly used in the various Member States;\\n- the product names may also be used in product names made up to designate other products, in accordance with custom,\\nprovided that such names are not liable to mislead the consumer.\\n2. For pre-packaged products weighing less than 20 g, the net weight need not be indicated on the labelling.\\n3.

That Decision demarcates protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) corresponding to specific epidemiological situations and lays down the conditions for providing exemptions from the exit ban laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban) on movements of animals in and from those zones.\\n(2) A Symposium on bluetongue was organised by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE, World Organisation for Animal Health) from 26 to 29 October 2003. One of the conclusions of that Symposium was that animals may move from an infected zone to a bluetongue-free zone without posing a risk of virus spread if they have been vaccinated at least one month prior to the date of movement, provided that the vaccine used covers all serotypes present in the area of origin.\\n(3) Taking into account that conclusion, the conditions for movements of vaccinated animals laid down in Decision 2003/828/EC were amended, on the basis of the situation prevailing during the last quarter of 2003, by Decision 2004/34/EC in order to allow such movements without requiring the cessation of the virus circulation in the area of origin or of the vector activity in the area of destination. Nevertheless, as a precaution, Decision 2003/828/EC, as amended by Decision 2004/34/EC, provided that possibility only for domestic movements from areas where the vaccination had been completed according to the programme adopted by the competent authority of the Member State concerned.\\n(4) After the third vaccination campaign which was conducted during winter 2003 to 2004 and the general reduction of the virus circulation in all the restricted zones concerned, it is now possible to consider general conditions for national movements of vaccinated animals from any restricted zones without taking into consideration the residual virus circulation in the area of origin. Nevertheless, as a precaution, animals should come from herds vaccinated according to the programme adopted by the competent authority of the Member State concerned and the vector surveillance programme in an epidemiologically relevant area of destination should have proved no adult Culicoïdes imicola activity.\\n(5) Article 3(1) of Decision 2003/828/EC provides for exemptions from the exit ban for domestic movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos and applies to certain restricted zones in France and Italy. It is appropriate to correct a clerical error concerning the omission of Spain from Article 3(1) of that Decision.\\n(6) Decision 2003/828/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\\n(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\\nDecision 2003/828/EC is amended as follows:\\n1. in Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\\n(a) the animals originate from a herd vaccinated according to the programme adopted by the competent authority;\\n(b) the animals have been vaccinated more than 30 days and less than one year before the date of dispatch against the serotype(s) present or possibly present in an epidemiologically relevant area of origin;\\n(c) the vector surveillance programme in an epidemiologically relevant area of destination has proved no adult Culicoïdes imicola activity.’;\\n2.

Such authorisations have to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.\\n(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.\\n(3) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.\\n(4) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.\\n(5) Information on new or changed uses of certain pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC and Directive 86/362/EEC has been notified to the Commission. This concerns kresoxim-methyl, cyromazine, bifenthrin, metalaxyl and azoxystrobin.\\n(6) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides, has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation\\xa0(4). It has been calculated that the MRLs concerned will ensure that the acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.\\n(7) An assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short term assessment is not needed.\\n(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of those pesticides.\\n(9) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for metalaxyl in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of metalaxyl or metalaxyl-M. The provisional Community MRL should then become definitive.\\n(10) Directives 90/642/EEC and 86/362/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\\n(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\\nPart A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.

whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;\\nWhereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;\\nWhereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;\\nWhereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;\\nWhereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;\\nWhereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;\\nWhereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;\\nWhereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;\\nWhereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality;

The assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the single programming document amounts to a maximum of ECU 13,532 million.\\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed implementing provisions which form an integral part of the single programming document.\\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 16 million for the public sector and ECU 0,6 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans, in particular from the EIB. 1. The breakdown among the Structural Funds of the total Community assistance available is as follows:\\n- ERDF: ECU 13,202 million,\\n- ESF: ECU 0,330 million.\\n2. The budgetary commitments at the moment of approval of the single programming document refer to the total Community assistance.\\n3. Payments subsequent to the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 shall be subject to confirmation by the Commission of the respect of the principle of additionality on the basis of the relevant information supplied by the Member State. The breakdown among the Structural Funds and the procedure for the grant of the assistance may be altered subsequently, subject to the availability of funds and the budgetary rules, in the light of adjustments decided according to the procedure laid down in Article 25 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88. The Community aid concerns expenditure on operations under the single programming document which, in the Member State concerned, are the subject of legally binding commitments and for which the requisite finance has been specifically allocated no later than 31 December 1999. The final date for taking account of expenditure on these measures is 31 December 2001. The single programming document shall be implemented in accordance with Community law, and in particular Articles 6, 30, 48, 52 and 59 of the Treaty and the Community Directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts.

The amended Annex V to the MARPOL Convention entered into force on 1 January 2013.\\n(2) This new categorization of garbage is reflected in IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.644/Rev.1, providing a standard format for the advance notification form for waste delivery to port reception facilities\\xa0(3), as well as in IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.645/Rev.1, providing a standard format for the waste delivery receipt following a ship's use of port reception facilities\\xa0(4).\\n(3) In the interest of consistency with IMO measures and in order to avoid uncertainty amongst port users and authorities, the table included in Annex II to Directive 2000/59/EC, which contains the different types and amounts of waste and cargo residues to be delivered or retained on board, should be adapted to the new categorisation of garbage of the amended Annex V to the MARPOL Convention.\\n(4) In addition, in order to improve the regime established under Directive 2000/59/EC, which aims at reducing discharges of ship-generated waste and cargo residues into the sea, information on the types and quantities of ship-generated waste actually delivered to port reception facilities in the last port of delivery should be included in the table of Annex II.\\n(5) The exact data on the types and amounts of the ship-generated waste and cargo residues delivered by a ship in the last port is essential for an accurate calculation of sufficient dedicated storage capacity on that ship. The calculation of sufficient storage capacity is a prerequisite for allowing the ship to proceed to the next port of call without having delivered its ship-generated waste, as well as for a proper selection of vessels for inspection. Better targeted inspections will contribute to the effective operation of maritime traffic, by reducing turnaround time in ports.\\n(6) This information may be available through waste receipts issued on basis of the IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.645/Rev.1, which recommends the standard format for the waste delivery receipt, or through other types of receipts issued to the master of the ship upon delivery of the waste. The amounts and types of waste indicated on the waste receipt or as declared by the master of the ship upon delivery in case a waste receipt cannot be obtained, would generally be more accurate than those available from the waste notification form, as they should reflect the actual situation after delivery and as such provide more reliability in the decision making process. The master of the ship records such delivery information in the Garbage Record Book as required by the MARPOL Convention.\\n(7) A systematic collection of accurate data on waste delivery would also allow a better statistical analysis of waste flow patterns in ports and facilitate the establishment of the information and monitoring system foreseen in Article 12(3) of Directive 2000/59/EC. The monitoring and exchange of such information, including the electronic waste notification developed under Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and the Council\\xa0(5), are currently supported by the Union maritime information and exchange system (SafeSeaNet), established by Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\\xa0(6), which should be linked to a reporting module within the Port State Control database\\xa0(7) set up under Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\\xa0(8).\\n(8) Annex II to Directive 2000/59/EC should be amended to include the information on waste delivery in the previous port and in order to incorporate the new categorization of garbage introduced by the amended MARPOL Annex V.\\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,\\nAnnex II to Directive 2000/59/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Directive. 1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 December 2016 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interest of clarity.\\n(2) Article 86 of the Treaty entrusts the Commission with the task of ensuring that, in the case of public undertakings and undertakings enjoying special or exclusive rights, Member States comply with their obligations under Community law. Pursuant to Article 86(3), the Commission can specify and clarify the obligations arising from that Article and, in that framework, set out the conditions which are necessary to allow the Commission to perform effectively the duty of surveillance imposed upon it by that paragraph.\\n(3) Directive 90/388/EEC required Member States to abolish special and exclusive rights for the provision of telecommunications services, initially for other services than voice telephony, satellite services and mobile radiocommunications, and then it gradually established full competition in the telecommunications market.\\n(4) A number of other Directives in this field have also been adopted under Article 95 of the Treaty by the European Parliament and the Council aiming, principally, at the establishment of an internal market for telecommunications services through the implementation of open network provision and the provision of a universal service in an environment of open and competitive markets. Those Directives should be repealed with effect from 25 July 2003 when the new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services is applied.\\n(5) The new electronic communications regulatory framework consists of one general Directive, Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)(3) and four specific Directives: Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)(4), Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)(5), Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users\\' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)(6), and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) sector(7).\\n(6) In the light of the developments which have marked the liberalisation process and the gradual opening of the telecommunications markets in Europe since 1990, certain definitions used in Directive 90/388/EEC and its amending acts should be adjusted in order to reflect the latest technological developments in the telecommunications field, or replaced in order to take account of the convergence phenomenon which has shaped the information technology, media and telecommunications industries over recent years. The wording of certain provisions should, where possible, be clarified in order to facilitate their application, taking into account, where appropriate, the relevant Directives adopted under Article 95 of the Treaty, and the experience acquired through the implementation of Directive 90/388/EEC as amended.\\n(7) This Directive makes reference to \"electronic communications services\" and \"electronic communications networks\" rather than the previously used terms \"telecommunications services\" and \"telecommunications networks\". These new definitions are indispensable in order to take account of the convergence phenomenon by bringing together under one single definition all electronic communications services and/or networks which are concerned with the conveyance of signals by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic means (i.e. fixed, wireless, cable television, satellite networks). Thus, the transmission and broadcasting of radio and television programmes should be recognised as an electronic communication service and networks used for such transmission and broadcasting should likewise be recognised as electronic communications networks. Furthermore, it should be made clear that the new definition of electronic communications networks also covers fibre networks which enable third parties, using their own switching or routing equipment, to convey signals.\\n(8) In this context, it should be made clear that Member States must remove (if they have not already done so) exclusive and special rights for the provision of all electronic communications networks, not just those for the provision of electronic communications services and should ensure that undertakings are entitled to provide such services without prejudice to the provisions of Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC. The definition of electronic communications networks should also mean that Member States are not permitted to restrict the right of an operator to establish, extend and/or provide a cable network on the ground that such network could also be used for the transmission of radio and television programming. In particular, special or exclusive rights which amount to restricting the use of electronic communications networks for the transmission and distribution of television signals are contrary to Article 86(1), read in conjunction with Article 43 (right of establishment) and/or Article 82(b) of the EC Treaty insofar as they have the effect of permitting a dominant undertaking to limit \"production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers\". This is, however, without prejudice to the specific rules adopted by the Member States in accordance with Community law, and, in particular, in accordance with Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989(8), on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(9), governing the distribution of audiovisual programmes intended for the general public.\\n(9) Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, Member States should no longer make the provision of electronic communications services and the establishment and provision of electronic communications networks subject to a licensing regime but to a general authorisation regime. This is also required by Directive 2002/20/EC, according to which electronic communications services or networks should be provided on the basis of a general authorisation and not on the basis of a license. An aggrieved party should have the right to challenge a decision preventing him from providing electronic communications services or networks before an independent body and, ultimately, before a court or a tribunal. It is a fundamental principle of Community law that an individual is entitled to effective judicial protection whenever a State measure violates rights conferred upon him by the provisions of a Directive.\\n(10) Public authorities may exercise a dominant influence on the behaviour of public undertakings, as a result either of the rules governing the undertaking or of the manner in which the shareholdings are distributed. Therefore, where Member States control vertically integrated network operators which operate networks which have been established under special or exclusive rights, those Member States should ensure that, in order to avoid potential breaches of the Treaty competition rules, such operators, when they enjoy a dominant position in the relevant market, do not discriminate in favour of their own activities. It follows that Member States should take all measures necessary to prevent any discrimination between such vertically integrated operators and their competitors.\\n(11) This Directive should also clarify the principle derived from Commission Directive 96/2/EC of 16 January 1996 amending Directive 90/388/EC with regard to mobile and personal communications(10), by providing that Member States should not grant exclusive or special rights of use of radio frequencies and that the rights of use of those frequencies should be assigned according to objective, non-discriminatory and transparent procedures. This should be without prejudice to specific criteria and procedures adopted by Member States to grant such rights to providers of radio or television broadcast content services with a view to pursuing general interest objectives in conformity with Community law.\\n(12) Any national scheme pursuant to Directive 2002/22/EC, serving to share the net cost of the provision of universal service obligations shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and shall be consistent with the principles of proportionality and of least market distortion. Least market distortion means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible.\\n(13) Where rights and obligations arising from international conventions setting up international satellite organisations are not compatible with the competition rules of the Treaty, Member States should take, in accordance with Article 307 of the EC Treaty, all appropriate steps to eliminate such incompatibilities. This Directive should clarify this obligation because Article 3 of Directive 94/46/EC(11), merely required Member States to \"communicate to the Commission\" the information they possessed on such incompatibilities. Article 11 of this Directive should clarify the obligation on Member States to remove any restrictions which could still be in force because of those international conventions.\\n(14) This Directive should maintain the obligation imposed on Member States by Directive 1999/64/EC, so as to ensure that dominant providers of electronic communications networks and publicly available telephone services operate their public electronic communication network and cable television network as separate legal entities.\\n(15) This Directive should be without prejudice to obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits set out in Annex I, Part B, within which the Member States are to comply with the preceding Directives.\\n(16) Member States should supply to the Commission any information which is necessary to demonstrate that existing national implementing legislation reflects the clarifications provided for in this Directive as compared with Directives 90/388/EC, 94/46/EC, 95/51/EC(12), 96/2/EC, 96/19/EC(13) and 1999/64/EC.\\n(17) In the light of the above, Directive 90/388/EC should be repealed,\\nDefinitions\\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\\n1. \"electronic communications network\" shall mean transmission systems and, where applicable, switching or routing equipment and other resources which permit the conveyance of signals by wire, by radio, by optical or by other electromagnetic means, including satellite networks, fixed (circuit - and packet - switched, including Internet) and mobile terrestrial networks, and electricity cable systems, to the extent that they are used for the purpose of transmitting signals, networks used for radio and television broadcasting, and cable television networks, irrespective of the type of information conveyed;\\n2. \"public communications network\" shall mean an electronic communications network used wholly or mainly for the provision of public electronic communications services;\\n3. \"electronic communications services\" shall mean a service normally provided for remuneration which consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks, including telecommunications services and transmission services in networks used for broadcasting but exclude services providing or exercising editorial control over, content transmitted using electronic communications networks and services; it does not include information society services as defined in Article 1 of Directive 98/34/EC which do not consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks;\\n4. \"publicly available electronic communications services\" shall mean electronic communications services available to the public;\\n5. \"exclusive rights\" shall mean the rights that are granted by a Member State to one undertaking through any legislative, regulatory or administrative instrument, reserving it the right to provide an electronic communications service or to undertake an electronic communications activity within a given geographical area;\\n6. \"special rights\" shall mean the rights that are granted by a Member State to a limited number of undertakings through any legislative, regulatory or administrative instrument which, within a given geographical area:\\n(a) designates or limits to two or more the number of such undertakings authorised to provide an electronic communications service or undertake an electronic communications activity, otherwise than according to objective, proportional and non-discriminatory criteria, or\\n(b) confers on undertakings, otherwise than according to such criteria, legal or regulatory advantages which substantially affect the ability of any other undertaking to provide the same electronic communications service or to undertake the same electronic communications activity in the same geographical area under substantially equivalent conditions;\\n7. \"satellite earth station network\" shall mean a configuration of two or more earth stations which interwork by means of a satellite;\\n8. \"cable television networks\" shall mean any mainly wire-based infrastructure established primarily for the delivery or distribution of radio or television broadcast to the public. Exclusive and special rights for electronic communications networks and electronic communications services\\n1. Member States shall not grant or maintain in force exclusive or special rights for the establishment and/or the provision of electronic communications networks, or for the provision of publicly available electronic communications services.\\n2. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that any undertaking is entitled to provide electronic communications services or to establish, extend or provide electronic communications networks.\\n3. Member States shall ensure that no restrictions are imposed or maintained on the provision of electronic communications services over electronic communications networks established by the providers of electronic communications services, over infrastructures provided by third parties, or by means of sharing networks, other facilities or sites without prejudice to the provisions of Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC.\\n4. Member States shall ensure that a general authorisation granted to an undertaking to provide electronic communications services or to establish and/or provide electronic communications networks, as well as the conditions attached thereto, shall be based on objective, non-discriminatory, proportionate and transparent criteria.\\n5. Reasons shall be given for any decision taken on the grounds set out in Article 3(1) of Directive 2002/20/EC preventing an undertaking from providing electronic communications services or networks.\\nAny aggrieved party should have the possibility to challenge such a decision before a body that is independent of the parties involved and ultimately before a court or a tribunal. Vertically integrated public undertakings\\nIn addition to the requirements set out in Article 2(2), and without prejudice to Article 14 of Directive 2002/21/EC, Member States, shall ensure that vertically integrated public undertakings which provide electronic communications networks and which are in a dominant position do not discriminate in favour of their own activities. Rights of use of frequencies\\nWithout prejudice to specific criteria and procedures adopted by Member States to grant rights of use of radio frequencies to providers of radio or television broadcast content services with a view to pursuing general interest objectives in conformity with Community law:\\n1. Member States shall not grant exclusive or special rights of use of radio frequencies for the provision of electronic communications services.\\n2. The assignment of radio frequencies for electronic communication services shall be based on objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria. Directory services\\nMember States shall ensure that all exclusive and/or special rights with regard to the establishment and provision of directory services on their territory, including both the publication of directories and directory enquiry services, are abolished. Universal service obligations\\n1. Any national scheme pursuant to Directive 2002/22/EC, serving to share the net cost of the provision of universal service obligations shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and shall be consistent with the principle of proportionality and of least market distortion. In particular, where universal service obligations are imposed in whole or in part on public undertakings providing electronic communications services, this shall be taken into consideration in calculating any contribution to the net cost of universal service obligations.\\n2. Member States shall communicate any scheme of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 to the Commission. Satellites\\n1. Member States shall ensure that any regulatory prohibition or restriction on the offer of space segment capacity to any authorised satellite earth station network operator are abolished, and shall authorise within their territory any space-segment supplier to verify that the satellite earth station network for use in connection with the space segment of the supplier in question is in conformity with the published conditions for access to such person\\'s space segment capacity.\\n2. Member States which are party to international conventions setting up international satellite organisations shall, where such conventions are not compatible with the competition rules of the EC Treaty, take all appropriate steps to eliminate such incompatibilities. Cable television networks\\n1. Each Member State shall ensure that no undertaking providing public electronic communications networks operates its cable television network using the same legal entity as it uses for its other public electronic communications network, when such undertaking:\\n(a) is controlled by that Member State or benefits from special rights; and\\n(b) is dominant in a substantial part of the common market in the provision of public electronic communications networks and publicly available telephone services; and\\n(c) operates a cable television network which has been established under special or exclusive right in the same geographic area.\\n2. The term \"publicly available telephone services\" shall be considered synonymous with the term \"public voice telephony services\" referred to in Article 1 of Directive 1999/64/EC.\\n3. Member States which consider that there is sufficient competition in the provision of local loop infrastructure and services in their territory shall inform the Commission accordingly.\\nSuch information shall include a detailed description of the market structure. The information provided shall be made available to any interested party on demand, regard being had to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business secrets.\\n4. The Commission shall decide within a reasonable period, after having heard the comments of these parties, whether the obligation of legal separation may be ended in the Member State concerned.\\n5. The Commission shall review the application of this Article not later than 31 December 2004. Member States shall supply to the Commission not later than 24 July 2003 such information as will allow the Commission to confirm that the provisions of this Directive have been complied with. 0\\nRepeal\\nDirective 90/388/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex I, Part A, is repealed with effect from 25 July 2003, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States in respect of the time limits for transposition laid down in Annex I, Part B.\\nReferences to the repealed Directives shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II. 1\\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 2\\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\\n\\n<<<END OF INPUT>>>\\n'}]",

This list has to be adapted by the appropriate terms used by Bulgaria and Romania.\\n(3) The list of the traditional specific terms, set up in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, and the list of the additional traditional terms, referred to in Article 23 of that Regulation, have to be adapted by the appropriate terms used by Bulgaria and Romania.\\n(4) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 lists vine varieties and their synonyms that include a geographical indication and that may appear on the labelling of wines. That Annex has to be adapted by the appropriate terms that have been used by Bulgaria and Romania at the date of application of this Regulation.\\n(5) The name ‘Tokaj’ designates a ‘quality wine produced in a specified region’originating in a cross border region of Hungary and Slovakia and is also part of the Italian and French vine variety designations: ‘Tocai italico’, ‘Tocai friulano’ and ‘Tokay pinot gris’. The co-existence of these three vine variety designations and the geographical indication is limited in time, until 31 March 2007 and results from the bilateral agreement of 23 November 1993 between the European Community and Republic of Hungary, which has become part of the acquis since 1 May 2004. As from 1 April 2007, these three vine varieties designations are removed from Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, and as far as the vine variety designation ‘Tocai friulano’ is concerned, it is now replaced by the new vine variety designation ‘Friulano’.\\n(6) Finally, Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 lists the traditional terms which appear or may appear on the labelling of wines.

However, portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools are exempted from that ban.\\n(2) The Commission has reviewed that exemption in accordance with Article 4(4) of Directive 2006/66/EC.\\n(3) That review has led to the conclusion that, in order to gradually diminish the amount of cadmium released into the environment, the prohibition of the use of cadmium should be extended to portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools because suitable cadmium-free substitutes for such applications are available on the market, namely nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion battery technologies.\\n(4) The existing exemption for portable batteries and accumulators intended for use in cordless power tools should continue to apply until 31 December 2016 in order to enable the recycling industry and consumers along the whole value chain to further adapt to the relevant substitute technologies across all the regions of the Union in a uniform manner.\\n(5) Directive 2006/66/EC prohibits the placing on the market of all batteries or accumulators, whether or not incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0,0005\\xa0% of mercury by weight. However, button cells with a mercury content of no more than 2\\xa0% by weight are exempted from that prohibition. The Union button cell market is already experiencing a shift towards mercury-free button cells.

Provisional measures\\n(1) By means of Regulation (EEC) No 3019/86 (2) the Commission, in connection with the review proceeding initiated on 26 November 1985 (3), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of standardized multi-phase electric motors, having an output of more than 0,75 kW but not more than 75 kW, originating in Romania.\\nCouncil Regulation (EEC) No 254/87 (4) extended the provisional duty for a period of two months.\\nB. Continuation of proceeding\\n(2) During the proceeding which followed the imposition of the provisional duty, the Romanian exporter said that its market share had fallen to an insignificant level in 1985, and therefore asked that the proceeding regarding it should be terminated without definitive measures being taken.\\nAlternatively, the exporter offered an undertaking concerning the minimum price level of its exports of standardized multi-phase motors to the Community.\\n(3) It is true that imports originating in Romania fell from 29 500 motors in 1982 to 13 900 in 1985, but they rose again to 39 000 in the first nine months of 1986. Without definitive measures, then, the market share held by imports from the country in question is liable to rise above a minimal level.\\nIn the light of the Council's definitive conclusions concerning dumping, injury, causal link and Community interest, as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 864/87 (5), the Commission finds that the imports in question threaten to increase the existing material injury caused to the Community standardized multi-phase motor industry.\\n(4) In these circumstances, it would be discriminatory vis-Ă\\xa0-vis the other exporters concerned to terminate the review proceeding without taking definitive measures regarding the Romanian exporter.\\nC. Undertaking\\n(5) The price undertaking by the Romanian exporter is at a level which should eliminate the threat of injury which the imports in question pose to the Community standardized multi-phase motor industry. The Commission therefore considers this price undertaking acceptable.\\nThe price undertaking offered by the exporter Electro-Export-Import (Romania) in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of standardized multi-phase electric motors having an output of more than 0,75 kW but not more than 75 kW falling within subheading ex 85.01 B I b) of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to Nimexe codes ex 85.01-33, ex 85.01-34 and ex 85.01-36, originating in Romania, is hereby accepted.\\n\\n<<<END OF INPUT>>>\\n\"}]",

PREVIOUS PROCEDURE\\n(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 (hereinafter referred to as \"the provisional Regulation\"), imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on certain imports of flat pallets of wood falling within CN code ex 4415 20 20 originating in the Republic of Poland and accepted undertakings offered from certain exporting producers. These undertakings concerned only one pallet type, i.e. the EUR pallet.\\n(2) Since sampling was used in the investigation, requests for reviews under Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 could not be accepted. However, in order to ensure equal treatment between new exporters and the cooperating companies not included in the sample during the original investigation, the provisional Regulation was amended. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 stipulated that new Polish exporting producers could have undertakings accepted with regard to exports of EUR pallets, provided they satisfied the criteria set out therein.\\n(3) By Regulation (EC) No 2334/97(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1521/2000(7), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland.\\nB. NEW EXPORTERS\\' REQUEST\\n(4) Following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2334/97, the following five further new Polish exporting producers have requested that Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 is applied to them and they offered undertakings with regard to the EUR pallets:\\n- P.P.D.B. \"Lesnik\" S.C., Krosno,\\n- \"Europal\" S.C., Brzeziny,\\n- P.P.U.H. \"Centropal\" Eksport-Import, Czajkow,\\n- Energomontaz Polnoc Serwis Sp.zo.o., Swierze Gorne,\\n- P.P.H. \"BOM\\'S\" S-ka zo.o., Suwalki.\\nThey have also provided sufficient evidence pursuant to the aforementioned Article of this regulation showing that they are genuine new exporting producers. In application of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1632/97, the undertakings offered by these five Polish exporting producers with regard to the EUR pallet should therefore be accepted.\\nC. WITHDRAWAL OF UNDERTAKING\\n(5) The following five Polish exporting producers, from which the Commission accepted the undertaking, have violated the undertaking by not complying with their reporting obligations as laid down in the undertaking:\\n- Internationale Paletten Company Sp., Lebork (TARIC additional code 8575 ),\\n- P.P.U.H. \"Drewmax\" Sp.zo.o., Krakow (TARIC additional code 8577 ),\\n- S.U.T.R. \"Rol Trak\", Prochowice (TARIC additional code 8714 ),\\n- Sliwka Lucyna, Klodzko (TARIC additional code 8445 ) and\\n- Produkcja - Skup Elementow i Palet, Stanislaw Gorecki, Czajkow (TARIC additional code 8483 ).\\n(6) One Polish producer, MACED Sklad Palet, J. Macionga, Miastko (TARIC additional code 8539 ), stated that they no longer produce the product concerned.\\n(7) Therefore, the Commission informed these six companies that it is intended to remove their names from the list of companies from which an undertaking was accepted. These companies did not object to this course of action.\\nD. COMPANIES SUBJECT TO THE UNDERTAKING\\n(8) For the sake of clarity all the companies subject to the undertaking are listed in the Annex to this Decision,\\nThe undertakings offered with regard to the EUR pallet by:\\n- P.P.D.B. \"Lesnik\" S.C., Krosno,\\n- \"EUROPAL\" S.C., Brzeziny,\\n- P.P.U.H. \"Centropal\" Eksport-Import, Czajkow,\\n- Energomontaz Polnoc Serwis Sp.zo.o., Swierze Gorne,\\n- P.P.H. \"BOM\\'S\" S-ka zo.o., Suwalki;\\nin connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of flat pallets of wood originating in Poland and falling within CN code ex 4415 20 20 are hereby accepted.

Therefore the date when the Community list of additives becomes a positive list can now be set. Taking into account the time the Authority will need to evaluate all valid applications submitted on time this date should be January 2010.\\n(6) It is also appropriate to clarify the role of the provisional list referred to in Article 4a (4) and (5) of Directive 2002/72/EC as it stands and how it will be updated. The provisional list contains those additives for which the necessary data were supplied on time and in accordance with the Authority’s requirements, but where no decision on their inclusion in the positive list has yet been taken.\\n(7) This provisional list provides information to the public on the additives that are under evaluation in view of their possible inclusion in the Community list of additives. As it is impossible to know if the evaluations for all the additives included in the provisional list will be completed by the date when the list of additives becomes a positive list, it should be possible to continue to use those additives, in accordance with national law, until their evaluation is completed and a decision is taken on their inclusion in the positive list of additives.\\n(8) When an additive included in the provisional list is inserted in the Community list of additives or when it is decided not to include it in the Community list, that additive should be removed from the provisional list of additives.\\n(9) If, during the examination of the data on an additive included in the provisional list, the Authority calls for supplementary information, that additive should be maintained in the provisional list until a decision is taken in relation to it, provided that the information is submitted within the time limits specified by the Authority.\\n(10) On the basis of new information related to the risk assessment of monomers and additives evaluated by the Authority\\xa0(3), certain additives admitted at national level as well as new monomers and additives should be included in the respective Community lists of authorised substances. For other substances, the restrictions and/or specifications already established at Community level should be amended on the basis of this new information. Therefore, Annexes II, III, IVa, V and VI of Directive 2002/72/EC should be amended accordingly.\\n(11) Commission Directive 2005/79/EC\\xa0(4) introduced in the list of additives the additive Ref. No 30340 with the name 12-(Acetoxy)stearic acid, 2,3-bis(acetoxy)propyl ester and CAS number 330198-91-9. The name and CAS number introduced in that Directive reflect only the main component of the application. However the opinion delivered by the Authority covers the mixture of substances referred to in the application and not only its main component. The mixture of substances is now registered in the CAS register under CAS number 736150-63-3 with the name Glycerides, castor-oil mono-, hydrogenated, acetates. For this reason it is now appropriate to change the name and CAS number to update the authorisation to all substances in the mixture. Taking into account the change of name a new Ref. No 55910 is assigned. As the substance is now covered by Ref. No 55910, Ref. No 30340 should be deleted.\\n(12) As a consequence, Directive 2002/72/EC should be updated to take account of new information related to the risk assessment of substances evaluated by the Authority, to establish the date when the list of additives becomes a positive list and to clarify the role of the provisional list of additives.\\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\\nDirective 2002/72/EC is amended as follows:\\n1. In Article 4, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\\n2. Article 4a is amended as follows:\\n(a) Paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\\n(b) Paragraph 6 is added:\\n(a) when it is included in the Community list of additives; or\\n(b) when a decision is taken by the Commission not to include it in the Community list of additives; or\\n(c) if during the examination of the data, the Authority calls for supplementary information and that information is not submitted within the time limits specified by the Authority.’\\n3.

That list includes fenoxycarb.\\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, fenoxycarb has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.\\n(3) Germany was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 12 September 2008 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 24 September 2010, in an assessment report.\\n(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing fenoxycarb may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include fenoxycarb in Annex I to that Directive.\\n(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to the environmental compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\\n(7) In view of the assumptions made during the risk assessment, it is appropriate to require that freshly treated timber is stored after treatment under shelter or on impermeable hardstanding, or both, and that any losses from the application of products used as wood preservatives and containing fenoxycarb are collected for reuse or disposal.\\n(8) In view of the risks identified for the aquatic compartment, appropriate measures should be taken to protect those compartments. Unacceptable risks were identified during the in-service use of treated wood not covered and not in contact with the ground, which is either continually exposed to the weather or protected from the weather but subject to frequent wetting (use class 3 as defined by OECD\\xa0(3)) in the specific scenario bridge over pond. It is therefore appropriate to require that products are not authorised for the treatment of wood intended for outdoor constructions near or above water, unless data is submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of Article 5 of, and Annex VI to Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.\\n(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance fenoxycarb and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\\n(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\\n(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\\n(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,\\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.

That list includes flocoumafen.\\n(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, flocoumafen has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 14, rodenticides, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.\\n(3) The Netherlands was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 4 October 2007 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\\n(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 15 May 2009, in an assessment report.\\n(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing flocoumafen may be expected not to present a risk to humans except for accidental incidents with children. A risk has been identified regarding non-target animals. However, flocoumafen is for the time being considered essential for reasons of public health and hygiene. It is therefore justified to include flocoumafen in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing flocoumafen can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\\n(6) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that specific risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing flocoumafen and used as rodenticides. Such measures should be aimed at limiting the risk of primary and secondary exposure of humans and non-target animals as well as the long-term effects of the substance on the environment. To this end, certain constraints such as the maximum concentration, the prohibition on marketing the active substance in products which are not ready to use and the use of aversive agents should be imposed across the board, while other conditions should be imposed by the Member States on a case-by-case basis.\\n(7) In view of the identified risks and its characteristics, which render it potentially persistent, liable to bioaccumulate and toxic, or very persistent and very liable to bioaccumulate, flocoumafen should be included in Annex I for five years only and should be made subject to a comparative risk assessment in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(5)(i) of Directive 98/8/EC before its inclusion in Annex I is renewed.\\n(8) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance flocoumafen and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\\n(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\\n(10) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 14 containing flocoumafen to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\\n(11) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\\n(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,\\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive. 1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 September 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 October 2011.\\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

whereas those areas are listed in Annex III to that Regulation and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86 (4); whereas Article 5 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the possibility of the premium being granted to producers keeping females of the ovine species of certain mountain breeds other than ewes which are eligible for the premium in certain areas; whereas those ewes and areas are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1970/87 (6);\\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the loss of income represents, per 100 kilograms of carcase weight, any difference there may be between the basic price and the arithmetic mean of the market prices recorded for each region;\\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the amount of the premium payable per ewe and per region is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in paragraph 2 by a coefficient representing, for each region, the normal average annual production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase weight;

Commission Directive 98/53/EC(4), as amended by Directive 2002/27/EC(5), should be amended to include specific provisions for maize to be subjected to sorting, or other physical treatment, before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.\\n(3) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach across the Union. These interpretation rules should be of application for the analytical result obtained on the sample for official control. In case of analysis for defence or referee purposes, the national rules apply.\\n(4) Directive 98/53/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\\nAnnex I to Directive 98/53/EC is amended as set out in Annex I to this Directive.\\nAnnex II to Directive 98/53/EC is amended as set out in Annex II to this Directive. 1.
