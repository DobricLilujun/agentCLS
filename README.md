This is a paper respository for classification of text using transformer related technology to investigate what are the main difference and if possible our new methods combining soft prompt tuning and discrete prompt enginnering.

We mainly consider ***Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT)***, ***Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)*** and ***Discrete Prompt Enginnering (DPE)*** as the new leading and commonly used technology.
