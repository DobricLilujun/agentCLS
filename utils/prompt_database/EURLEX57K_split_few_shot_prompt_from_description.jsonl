The objective is to ensure accurate classification by critically analyzing the content, context, and specific details of the input text.\n\n## Category Descriptions\n\n### Label: Regulation  \n**Description:** Texts that detail formal regulations issued by governmental or other authoritative bodies. These texts typically specify rules or laws that are legally binding and directly applicable across relevant jurisdictions. They often include details such as effective dates, the entities affected, and the specific mandates or prohibitions imposed.\n\n### Label: Directive  \n**Description:** The \"Directive\" category is designated for texts that detail formal legislative directives issued by authoritative bodies such as the European Parliament and the Council. These texts typically discuss amendments to existing laws, set new regulatory standards, and outline implementation guidelines and deadlines. The content should reflect the introduction or modification of policies, particularly in the context of environmental, health, or safety regulations.\n\n## Examples for Classification\n\n### Example 1: Regulation\n**Input Text:**  \n\"Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3644/88, enacted on 23 November 1988, established the minimum price for blood oranges withdrawn from the market and sold to processing industries for the 1988/89 marketing year. This regulation, rooted in the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, specifies that the minimum selling price should be set prior to each marketing year, considering the normal supply price to the industry. For the specified marketing year, the price was fixed at 52.42 ECU per tonne net, ex warehouse. The regulation, which aligns with the advice of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables, became effective on 1 December 1988 and is legally binding and directly applicable across all Member States. This measure ensures a standardized price for blood oranges destined for processing, reflecting broader market management strategies within the European Economic Community's framework for fruit and vegetables.\"\n\n**Classification Reasoning:**  \nThis text outlines a specific regulation setting a minimum price for blood oranges, indicating the effective date and the legal framework it operates within, thereby affecting the relevant market practices.
