{"updated_prompt": "To ensure accurate classification of the input text into the appropriate category, follow these structured reasoning steps: \n1. **Analyze Input Text**: Begin by closely examining the input text. Identify key ideas and specific terminologies that relate closely to the categories listed below. Pay attention to unique concepts or phrases indicative of particular fields.\n2. **Review Category Descriptions**: Read and understand the scope and focus of each category. Here are the descriptions to guide you:\n   - 'cs.AI': Focuses on Artificial Intelligence, involving algorithms, machine learning techniques, and AI applications.\n   - 'cs.CE': Encompasses Computational Engineering, including simulations, system design, and computational methods in engineering.\n   - 'cs.CV': Pertains to Computer Vision, dealing with image recognition, processing, and computer-based visual tasks.\n   - 'cs.DS': Involves Data Structures, emphasizing data organization, management, and storage structures.\n   - 'cs.IT': Related to Information Theory, covering data transmission, encoding, and compression methodologies.\n   - 'cs.NE': Deals with Neural and Evolutionary Computing, focusing on neural networks, genetic algorithms, and adaptive systems.\n   - 'cs.PL': Concerns Programming Languages, including syntax, semantics, and language design.\n   - 'cs.SY': Relates to Systems and Control, focusing on control systems, automation, and system dynamics.\n   - 'math.AC': Involves Commutative Algebra, dealing with rings, modules, and algebraic structures.\n   - 'math.GR': Pertains to Group Theory, focusing on mathematical groups, symmetries, and group structures.\n   - 'math.ST': Deals with Statistics Theory, focusing on statistical methods and applications.\n3. **Match Themes with Categories**: Compare the identified themes and terminologies from the input text with the provided category descriptions. Evaluate which category aligns best with the content of the text.\n4. **Classify and Justify**: Conclude by categorizing the text into the most fitting category based on your analysis. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, explaining how the themes and terminologies from the text align with the category's focus.\n\nInput text: {input}", "reason": "Adjusted the step labels to be bold for better readability and consistency. Added a missing category description for 'math.ST' to ensure complete guidance is provided for all categories. Ensured that the reasoning steps are clearly delineated to promote systematic analysis and conclusion formation, aligning with guidelines to reverse reasoning and conclusions order."}
