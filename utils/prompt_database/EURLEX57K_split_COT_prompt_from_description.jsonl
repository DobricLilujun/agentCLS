This approach helps to clarify how the input text should be analyzed and matched with the appropriate category based on its content. The reasoning steps guide the model to consider the themes and messages of the text and compare them against detailed category descriptions, ensuring a more accurate classification. By specifying what each category involves, the model can make more informed decisions, improving the quality of the output."}
{"updated_prompt": "First, read and understand the text provided. Consider the definitions of each category: Decision involves determining a choice among alternatives; Directive involves instructions or commands that should be followed; Regulation involves rules or directives made and maintained by an authority.

Based on your analysis, classify the text into one of the following categories: Decision, Directive, or Regulation. \n\n{text: {input}}", "reason": "The refinement was made to include a clear step-by-step reasoning process before the classification decision. The prompt now starts with an instruction to understand the text and consider the category definitions, which guides the model in its analytical process. The explicit mention of each category and its definition helps in accurate classification. The structure is preserved with minimal changes to enhance clarity and ensure consistency in following the guidelines."}
{"updated_prompt": "To accurately classify the input text, consider the following category descriptions: \n- **Decision**: Texts that involve making or describing decisions. \n- **Directive**: Texts that instruct or command specific actions. \n- **Regulation**: Texts that outline rules, guidelines, or laws. \n\nFirst, read the text and identify key phrases or terms that align with these categories. Then, analyze the context and purpose of the text. Based on this analysis, classify the text into one of the three categories: Decision, Directive, or Regulation. \n\nPlease classify the following input text into the appropriate category: \n\n{input}", "reason": "The prompt was updated to include detailed descriptions of each category to guide the classification process. This helps ensure the language model understands the context and criteria for each category before making a classification. The order of operations was adjusted to emphasize reasoning (analysis of text based on category descriptions) before reaching a conclusion (classification)."}
{"updated_prompt": "To accurately classify text into the categories of 'Decision', 'Directive', or 'Regulation', follow this structured reasoning process: \n1. Begin by comprehensively reading the text to grasp its content and intent. \n2. Evaluate whether the text primarily involves making a choice or reaching a conclusion, which would classify it as a 'Decision'. Identify critical phrases and structures that suggest a decision-making process. Place this assessment under the reasoning field. \n3. If the text primarily directs or instructs actions, categorize it as a 'Directive'. Look for directive language or commands that are indicative of this classification. This evaluation should also be placed under the reasoning field. \n4. Assess if the text establishes rules or guidelines, categorizing it as a 'Regulation'. Search for terms and formats typical of regulatory texts and include this in the reasoning field. \n5. After completing these reasoning steps, assign the text to the most fitting category based on the evidence gathered. This conclusion should be detailed in the conclusion field. {input}", "reason": "The prompt has been refined to enhance clarity and ensure that the reasoning steps are followed before reaching a conclusion. This structured approach helps in maintaining consistency and accuracy in text classification."}
{"updated_prompt": "To accurately classify the input text into one of the defined categories, follow these steps in sequential order:\n1. **Analysis**: Begin by thoroughly examining the content of the text. Look for key elements that indicate the nature of the text:\n   - For 'Decision', identify choices, conclusions, or determinations. Assess how explicitly the decision-making process is portrayed.\n   - For 'Directive', look for commands, instructions, or guidelines that aim to direct the actions or decisions of others.\n   - For 'Regulation', check for rules or guidelines that are meant to govern behavior or processes.\n2. **Reasoning**: Based on the elements identified in the analysis step, determine which category the text aligns with more strongly. Consider whether the text predominantly features decision-making elements, directive instructions, or regulatory guidelines.\n3. **Conclusion**: Classify the text into 'Decision', 'Directive', or 'Regulation', depending on which category is most significantly represented in the text.\n\nText to classify:{input}", "reason": "Enhanced the existing prompt by explicitly separating the process into clear steps of Analysis, Reasoning, and Conclusion to encourage a structured approach to classification. This structure will help in maintaining an orderly evaluation of the text, ensuring that the conclusions are based on a systematic reasoning process. This is crucial for achieving consistent and accurate classifications."}
{"updated_prompt": "To ensure accurate classification of the input text into the appropriate category, begin by carefully reading the provided text. Analyze essential aspects such as key themes and keywords, and assess how they relate to the predefined categories. Proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Key Themes and Keywords**: Note down the primary themes and significant keywords found in the text.\n2. **Reasoning**: Based on the identified themes and keywords, explain their connection and relevance to the categories described below:\n   - **Decision**: Pertains to making choices or reaching conclusions.\n   - **Directive**: Involves instructions or commands.\n   - **Regulation**: Pertains to rules or laws that must be followed.\n3. **Classification**: After providing the reasoning, classify the text. Ensure the classification is based on the analysis of the content and context of the text, and aligns with one of the categories listed.\n\nPlease classify the following input text into the appropriate category:\n\n{input}", "reason": "The refinement enhances clarity and structure by breaking down the task into clear steps and explicitly incorporating the category for 'Regulation' that was missing in the previous prompt. It also reorders the process to place reasoning before the conclusion, aligning with the guidelines for chain of reasoning prompts."}
{"updated_prompt": "To accurately classify the input text, start by analyzing the input to determine its primary intent and details. Focus on extracting specific keywords or phrases that align with the characteristics of the three categories: 'Decision', 'Directive', and 'Regulation'. \n\n1. For texts fitting the 'Decision' category, look for language indicating choices or conclusions, such as 'decide', 'conclude', or 'choose'. \n2. For 'Directive', search for commands or instructional language like 'must', 'should', or 'required'. \n3. For 'Regulation', identify terms that pertain to rules or standards, such as 'regulation', 'rule', or 'standard'. \n\nAfter identifying these key elements, compare them against the detailed category descriptions provided: \n- Decision: Involves making a choice or conclusion. \n- Directive: Contains commands or instructions. \n- Regulation: Involves setting rules or standards. \n\nConclude by linking the identified elements with the most fitting category based on the evidence gathered.
