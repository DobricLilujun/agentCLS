Ensure to reason through the content of the text before reaching a conclusion on its classification. Categories include: 1. **Decision**: This category should be selected if the text involves making a choice or selecting an option. 2. **Directive**: Choose this category if the text instructs or commands an action. 3. **Regulation**: This category applies if the text pertains to rules or laws that are meant to control or govern behavior. After analyzing the text, classify it into the most appropriate category.\n\nInput Text: {input}\n\nOutput Format: Provide the classification in a short sentence format, stating the category name followed by a brief justification based on the content of the text.", "reason": "The refinement enhances clarity by defining each category with specific descriptions, ensuring that the classification is based on a reasoned analysis of the text. It also specifies the output format to maintain consistency and precision in responses."}
{"updated_prompt": "Classify the given input text into one of the following categories based on the descriptions provided. Ensure your classification reasoning precedes the conclusion to maintain logical flow.\n\nCategories:\n1. **Decision** - Choose this category if the text involves making a choice or selecting an option.\n2. **Directive** - Use this category if the text instructs or commands an action.\n3. **Regulation** - Appropriate for texts that stipulate rules or guidelines.\n\nText for Classification:\n{input}\n\n**Procedure**:\n1. Analyze the content of the text.\n2. Match the text's theme with the most fitting category based on the descriptions above.\n3. Provide your reasoning first, explaining why the text fits into the selected category.\n4. State your final classification as the conclusion.", "reason": "The prompt was refined for enhanced clarity and precision. Category descriptions were explicitly stated to guide accurate classification. The reasoning-conclusion order was emphasized to ensure logical processing of the task."}
{"updated_prompt": "Classify the text provided into one of the following categories based on the descriptions below:\n\n- **Decision**: Choose this category if the content involves making a choice or selecting an option.\n- **Directive**: Select this category if the text instructs or guides actions to be taken.\n- **Regulation**: Use this category if the text pertains to rules or laws that govern behavior.\n\nText to classify: {input}\n\nEnsure to list the reasoning before drawing a conclusion by analyzing the content of the text and matching it with the most fitting category description. The classification should be the final part of your analysis.", "reason": "The refinement clarifies the descriptions of each category to ensure accurate classification by the language model. It adds a structured approach by prompting the model to reason first and conclude with the classification, thereby enhancing the quality and accuracy of the output."}
{"updated_prompt": "Classify the input text by determining which category best describes it. Use the following category descriptions to guide your classification:\n\n- **Decision**: Involves making a choice between options or determining a course of action.\n- **Directive**: Involves giving instructions or commands.\n- **Regulation**: Involves rules or directives made and maintained by an authority.\n\n{input}\n\nAfter analyzing the text, classify it into one of the above categories. The output should be in JSON format, specifying the category as follows: {\"category\": \"[chosen category]\"}. Ensure that the classification reasoning precedes the conclusion, presenting the reasoning first and then the final classification.", "reason": "The prompt has been refined for clarity and precision. Category descriptions are integrated directly into the prompt to guide the classification process effectively. The output format is explicitly defined as JSON, aligning with best practices for structured data output. The reasoning order is specified to ensure that reasoning precedes the conclusion, enhancing the logical flow of task completion."}
{"updated_prompt": "Classify the text provided in the placeholder {input} based on the following category descriptions:\n\n1. **Decision**: Texts that involve making choices or selecting between alternatives.\n2. **Directive**: Texts that contain instructions, commands, or guidelines directing action or policy.\n3. **Regulation**: Texts that establish rules or principles governing conduct or activity.\n\nEnsure that the classification is reasoned before reaching a conclusion, following these steps:\n- First, analyze the content of the text to determine its main purpose.\n- Then, match the text's purpose against the category descriptions provided.\n- Finally, classify the text into the most fitting category: Decision, Directive, or Regulation.", "reason": "The refinement ensures clarity by explicitly describing each category, which aids in more accurate classification. The structured approach enhances understanding and consistency, and the inclusion of a reasoning process before the conclusion helps in logical decision-making."}
